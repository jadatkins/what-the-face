# 6. UI Component Library

Date: 2025-06-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application needs a UI component library that provides pre-built, accessible components to accelerate development while maintaining a modern, professional appearance. The choice should balance rapid prototyping capabilities with learning opportunities for industry-standard technologies.

## Decision

We will use **shadcn/ui** (built on **Tailwind CSS**) as our UI component library.

### Alternatives Considered

- **Mantine** - Rejected in favor of learning industry-standard Tailwind CSS patterns
- **Chakra UI** - Rejected for similar reasons as Mantine and a larger bundle size
- **Material-UI (MUI)** - Rejected due to heavy enterprise focus and complexity beyond project requirements

### Key Factors

- **Modern styling**: Components come ready-styled out of the box
- **Learning opportunity**: Exposure to Tailwind CSS, widely adopted across the industry
- **Flexibility**: Copy-paste approach enables deep customization when needed
- **Bundle optimization**: Only includes components actually used in the project

## Consequences

**What becomes easier:**
- Learning industry-standard Tailwind CSS utility patterns
- Deep customization of components through direct code access
- Bundle optimization by including only used components

**What becomes more difficult:**
- Slightly more complex initial setup compared to package-based libraries
- Managing component updates manually rather than through package updates
- Additional configuration file in repository (Tailwind config)

**Risks:**
- Potential bundle size growth with additional components
- Potential inconsistency if components are modified without design system considerations
