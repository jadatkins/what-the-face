# 6. UI Component Library

Date: 2025-06-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application needs a UI component library that provides pre-built, accessible components to accelerate development while maintaining a modern, professional appearance. The choice should minimize configuration overhead and provide good TypeScript integration.

## Decision

We will use **Mantine** as our UI component library.

### Alternatives Considered

- **Chakra UI** - Rejected due to larger bundle size and more setup complexity than needed
- **shadcn/ui** - Rejected due to requiring more configuration and Tailwind CSS setup overhead  
- **Material-UI (MUI)** - Rejected as it's more enterprise-focused and opinionated than needed for this project

### Key Factors

- **Ease of use**: Mantine provides "100+ customizable components" with minimal setup
- **Modern styling**: Offers modern design patterns out of the box
- **Developer experience**: More opinionated approach reduces decision fatigue
- **Bundle size**: Lighter weight compared to some alternatives
- **TypeScript support**: Excellent TypeScript integration

## Consequences

**What becomes easier:**
- Rapid prototyping with pre-built, accessible components
- Consistent design system without custom CSS
- Modern styling and theming out of the box
- Reduced time spent on component implementation
- Built-in accessibility features

**What becomes more difficult:**
- Less flexibility for highly custom designs compared to utility-first approaches
- Potential need to override Mantine styles for unique requirements
- Learning Mantine-specific APIs and patterns

**Risks:**
- Dependency on Mantine's maintenance and future development
- Potential bundle size growth with additional components
- Migration complexity if switching to different UI library later
