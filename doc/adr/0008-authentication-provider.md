# 8. Authentication Provider

Date: 2025-06-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application requires user authentication functionality including user registration, login, session management, and potentially social authentication. Rather than building authentication from scratch, we need a third-party provider that offers good developer experience, security, and integration with our stack.

## Decision

We will use **Clerk** as our authentication provider.

### Alternatives Considered

- **SuperTokens** - Rejected in favor of Clerk's more polished developer experience and better documentation
- **Auth0** - Considered but may be overkill for a hobby project with potentially higher costs at scale
- **Firebase Auth** - Rejected as it would introduce Google ecosystem dependency
- **Custom authentication** - Rejected due to security complexity and development time requirements

### Key Factors

- **Developer experience**: Clerk provides more polished DX and better documentation
- **Security**: Handles complex security requirements professionally
- **Integration**: Good compatibility with React and our chosen stack
- **Cost**: Reasonable free tier for hobby projects
- **Maintenance**: Reduces security and maintenance burden

## Consequences

**What becomes easier:**
- Rapid implementation of complete authentication system
- Professional security practices without expertise requirement
- Social authentication integration (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- User management and session handling
- Compliance with security best practices

**What becomes more difficult:**
- Vendor dependency for critical authentication functionality
- Potential costs as user base grows
- Less control over authentication flow customization
- Integration complexity if migrating away from Clerk

**Risks:**
- Vendor lock-in for user authentication data
- Service availability dependency
- Pricing changes affecting project viability
- Limited customization for unique authentication requirements
