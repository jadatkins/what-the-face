# 2. Core Language and Frontend Framework Selection

Date: 2025-06-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Starting a new web application project with learning goals in mind. The primary objective is to gain experience with modern, industry-standard technologies that will be valuable for career development while building a personal hobby project.

## Decision

We will use:
- **TypeScript** for backend development
- **React** for frontend framework

### Alternatives Considered

**Frontend Framework Alternatives:**
- **Vue.js** - Rejected due to lower adoption rates among employers compared to React, reducing the transferable value of skills gained
- **Angular** - Rejected due to steeper learning curve and enterprise-focused structure that adds unnecessary complexity for a small hobby project
- **Solid.js** - Rejected as it would require more work to implement compared to React's mature ecosystem

**Backend Language Alternatives:**
- No alternatives were seriously considered - TypeScript was chosen based on external recommendation as a learning opportunity

## Consequences

**What becomes easier:**
- Leveraging React's extensive ecosystem and community resources
- Finding documentation, tutorials, and solutions to common problems
- Building transferable skills valuable in the job market
- Type safety across the entire stack with TypeScript

**What becomes more difficult:**
- Potential verbosity of TypeScript compared to plain JavaScript
- React's learning curve for advanced patterns and state management

**Risks:**
- Limited - these are well-established, mainstream technologies with strong community support
